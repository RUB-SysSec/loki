INSTALL file for libdvdcss, a DVD access library


Configuring libdvdcss
=====================

A typical way to configure libdvdcss is:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

See `./configure --help' for more information.


If you got libdvdcss from its version control system, please bootstrap first:

  autoreconf -i


Building libdvdcss
==================

Once configured, run `make' to build libdvdcss.

If you have player keys, you need to put them in the file csskeys.h, before
configuring libdvdcss to enable the "key" method (the one from libcss).


Installing libdvdcss
====================

You can install libdvdcss by typing:

  make install


Building libdvdcss for Windows
==============================

There are two alternative ways to build libdvdcss for Windows.

- on a host with the mingw-w64 cross-compilers:

 Tell configure about the compiler to use. If you run, for example, Debian,
 Ubuntu, or Cygwin under Windows with the necessary mingw64 packages
 installed, it would be:

 for a 32-bit target platform:
  ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32
  make

 or for a 64-bit target platform:
  ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32
  make 

- natively on Windows with MSYS + MinGW (www.mingw.org):

 (MSYS is a minimal build environment to compile Unixish projects under
  Windows. It provides all the common Unix tools like sh, GNU Make...)

 You will need to download and install the latest MSYS and MinGW.

 To build libdvdcss you just have to run the following commands:

  ./configure
  make
